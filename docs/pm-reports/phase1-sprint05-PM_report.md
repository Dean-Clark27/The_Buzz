## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * We met during the recitation time for about 30 mins

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * We don't use Trello

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * We have a zoom call each week and the team is in contact through slack during the week

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
    * Used Jira and slack to stay on top of all tasks needed to be finished for the week

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
    * No difficulties

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * I'm not sure exactly what I will need to be doing as PM so figuring that out while also having pacing break might be a bit of a challenge

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * This week we didn't have any significant obstacles

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    * Something I want to start doing is checking in more often and seeing how people are doing earlier in the week
    * Something I want to stop is people waiting till later in the week to get started
    * Something I want to continue is the frequency at which communication is used

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
    * I estimated the time everything would take well and there were no major changes as the sprint progressed

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * There is currently not any code done as we were just in the design phase
